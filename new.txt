install like this:

npm i node-sass (just change the app.css to app.scss)

imr - import react
imdr - import ReactDom
imd - import {} from "module"

The difference between these two, is that devDependencies are modules which are only required during development,
while dependencies are modules which are also required at runtime. To save a dependency as a devDependency on 
installation we need to do an npm install --save-dev , instead of just an npm install --save
